  "summary": "The implementation adds 50 Indian Constitution laws with complete explanations through a data initialization system. The backend was updated with an initializeLaws method that populates laws on first load, and the frontend includes a new initialLaws.ts data file containing 50 law entries. The implementation preserves the 51-law capacity, maintains the burgundy/gold theme, and doesn't modify the immutable frontend paths specified in constraints.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asks to 'Add 50 laws' but does not specify that they should be automatically initialized on app startup. The implementation added a complete initialization system including LawInitializer.tsx component, useInitializeLaws.ts hook, and initializeLaws backend method.",
